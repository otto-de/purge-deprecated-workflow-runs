### remarks on the input fields
<dl>
<dt>

`token`</dt>
<dd>

- Using **`github.token`** usually works, unless the actions are not scoped with `repo` rights. For more details, see the [**`GITHUB_TOKEN`**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow).
- If the workflow has issues, you may need to use a personal access token (PAT) that must have the **`repo`** scope. More details, see "[Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)".
